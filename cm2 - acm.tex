\begin{abstract}
Human-level concept learning argues that human usually learns new concepts from just a single example unlike the machine learning algorithms that typically require hundreds of samples to learn a single concept. Our brain subconsciously picks up the important features and learns in a richer way.

In this paper, we present a coordinate matrix-based approach that augments human intelligence to learn the structure of the document and use this information to classify the documents. Our approach only processes important features that are what a human considers for classification. Although the documents are more structured and contains very similar content to one another, only one sample is used per class similar to what a human needs to do similar task.

Our algorithm outperforms every popular vectoriser techniques in combination with traditional machine learning and most advanced deep learning models that rely on a larger number of elements to achieve good accuracy. The advantages of our algorithm are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Better accuracy
\item Faster computation
\item Generic, expandable and extendable
\item Explainable
\item Robust against unbalanced classes
\item Does not require large number of labelled data
\end{enumerate}
