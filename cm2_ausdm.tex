\begin{abstract}
Document classification, in general, focuses primarily on the context of the document and classify based on its belonging to one or more classes. However, if the documents are more structured and contains very similar content to one another, then traditional approaches do not yield the required high accuracy demanded by many applications.

\textbf{Contribution.} In this paper, we have proposed a coordinate matrix-based approach which augments human intelligence to create a very small vector to learn the structure of the document and use this information to classify the documents.

\textbf{Result.} The algorithm outperforms every popular vectoriser techniques in combination with traditional machine learning and most advanced deep learning models that rely on a larger number of elements to achieve good accuracy. The advantages of our algorithm are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Better accuracy
\item Faster computation
\item Small memory footprint
\item Generic, expandable and extendable
\item Explainable
\item Robust against unbalanced classes
\item Does not require large number of labelled data
\end{enumerate}
